# .cursorrules

- Never put setState in a useEffect. This is always a bug. Derive these values during render. 
- Always put event handlers inline right in the component. Avoid any situations that require intermediate variable or function names
- Never use multiple arguments in a function, always use an object.

XState

We're using XState 5, so use the new syntax
```diff
- assign((context, event) => {
+ assign(({ event }) => {
```

## Global Rules
- At the end of every conversation, review what was learned or decided and write it to this file.
- Each repository has its own dedicated section to track decisions, progress, and next steps.
- Use timestamps for all entries in the format **YYYY-MM-DD**.
- For decisions, use ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format with Context, Decision, and Consequences.

### Format Template
#### Progress
- **YYYY-MM-DD**: [Description of progress made]

#### Decisions
- **YYYY-MM-DD**: [Title]
  - **Context**: [Why this decision was needed]
  - **Decision**: [What was decided]

#### Next Steps
1. [Numbered list of next actions]
