# Favicon

This directory has the icons used for android devices. In some cases, we cannot
reliably detect light/dark mode preference. Hence these icons should not have a
transparent background. These icons are referenced in the `site.webmanifest`
file.

The icons used by modern browsers and Apple devices are in `app/assets/favicons`
as they can be imported with a fingerprint to bust the browser cache.

Note, there's also a `favicon.ico` in the root of `/public` which some older
browsers will request automatically. This is a fallback for those browsers.
